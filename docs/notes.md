Decoding
========

Instruction set 2-51 p70  
Instruction encoding 4-22 p259

Memory
======

```
00H through 7FH (128 bytes) interrupt (system + reserved)
+80H - 3FFH (available)
1k memory total, 256 interrupts
00, 01: IP offset
02, 03: CS base address
```

```
IO:
F8H through FFH (eight of the 64k locations) in the I/O space are reserved by Intel Corporation for use by future Intel hardware
```

Possible Optimizations
======================

- Use macros for inc_ip_b, inc_ip_w, inc_sp_w, dec_sp_w, execute_inc, execute_dec, read_b, write_b. The same algorithm is in many places.
- Use macros for all the arg_* functions, there's a lot of copy pasta there.
- Optimize read_cs_ip_* to call read_b directly, to avoid multiple function calls.
- Look at the most used path in decode_mod_rm, make sure it is fast.

- Use a second level table for decoding the group instructions
  e.g. exec_fn, args_fn, N           means call it directly
       second_level_table, -1, -1   means split away the MOD, go through a second level table
  The second level table would allow its own args_fn to handle instructions with strange parameter count

- Avoid args_fn as much as possible, I think the whole locations concept is eating too much performance.
  Wait for performance measurements first.
- read_cs_ip_b/read_cs_ip_w are quite heavy (because of physical address calculation) and seems to be used a lot, try to optimize
- think about optimizing the wraparounds and calculations in read_seg_off_*, write_seg_off_*
